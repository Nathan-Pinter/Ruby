Loops

for number in [1,2,3,4,5] do
  # do something with number
end

This is the basic for loop. It is (almost) functionally equivalant to the each loop.

[1,2,3,4,5].each do |number|
  # do something with number
end

We have other types of loop, too.

while conditional
  # do something while conditional is true
end

until conditional
  # do something until conditional is true
end

Left alone, these loops will continue to execute until their conditions evaluate to false or until their sequence is empty. There are other ways to terminate a loop early, should the need arise.

while conditional
  break # terminate the current loop
  next  # skip to the next iteration of the loop
  redo  # restart the current iteration
end
