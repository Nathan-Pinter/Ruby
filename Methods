Methods

As you might expect, Ruby allows you to define your own methods.

def say_hello
  puts "Hello, world!"
end

A method can also take one or more arguments.

def greet(someone)
  puts "Hello, #{someone}!"
end

You can supply default arguments to your methods.

def greet(someone="world")
  puts "Hello, #{someone}!"
end
greet
# Hello, world!

You will commonly find yourself supplying more than one argument to your methods.

def foo(bar, boo, baz)
end
