Control Flow

There are many times that you will wish to control what part of your application executes based on some condition.

if condition
  # do something
end
There are times that you will want to do something if the condition is true, and if it is false, something else entirely.

if condition
  # do something
else
  # do something else entirely
end
There are times that you will want to do something unless a condition is true.

unless condition
  # do something
end
